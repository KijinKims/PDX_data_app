# PDX_data_app

The codes were used for developing data portal application which show the analysis results of comprehensive genome analysis of PDX (Patient Derived Xenograft) from cancer patients.    
Codes are written in R and took advantage of R shiny library.  
Running application compiled from the code is provided at this [link](http://ccgd.snu.ac.kr/Data.html).
